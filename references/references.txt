The idea of spectral rendering is as follows:
- For each material, we have the following:
  - A function that takes in a wavelength and returns how much of the light is absorbed vs. re-emitted, either reflected, or transmitted
  - If the material is input as a standard RGB texture, we might have to do some conversions here

For each pixel of the resulting image, we do the following:
  1. Generate a ray at random through that pixel, in a random direction and with a random wavelength
  2. Trace that ray through the scene, computing the intensity of the incoming light along the ray
  3. Add this intensity sample to the pixel data
  4. After repeating this a few times, integrate the wavelength intensities to get RGB values
